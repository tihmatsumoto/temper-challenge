### Bugs

- For any user, zipcode can have letters only, which can be considered a bug, as most zipcode are numbers or a mix of number/letters.

- For any user, you can make an empty order, either by not clicking at an item and going to cart, or by simpling removing an item and proceeding to checkout.

- Problem user shows all product items as dog photos.

- Problem user doesn't allow Last Name to be added in Checkout, blocking user from finish buying items.

- Problem user doesn't allow filtering.

- Every request in Performance_Glitch_User takes longer to happen. From login to filtering, to adding items to cart.
